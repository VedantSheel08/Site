  intro:
    "Hi, I‚Äôm Vedant Sheel. I am a 17 year old SHSM student at Waterdown District High School, a machine learning researcher, and passionate about building tech with purpose. I‚Äôm currently a research intern at McMaster University, where I‚Äôm working on AI models to help predict lung disease, and I previously did machine learning research at the University of Waterloo. I‚Äôve also worked as a software engineering intern at Clearcable Networks, building automation tools that improve how teams work. At school, I lead the Robotics, Coding, Math, HSA and DECA clubs, and I‚Äôve earned two silver medals at the Canada-Wide Science Fair for real-world AI projects that tackle environmental, and accessibility challenges. I believe in using technology to make a real difference, and I‚Äôm driven to keep learning, building, and solving problems that matter.",
