# PDF Files Setup

To make the research papers work properly, please add these PDF files to the `public/` directory:

1. `Immediate Pulmonary Fibrosis Prognosis Using Machine Learning Algorithms.pdf`
2. `Smart Solar Tracker.pdf`
3. `A Voice For The Voiceless.pdf`

## How to add them:

1. Copy your PDF files to the `public/` folder in your project
2. Make sure the filenames match exactly (including spaces and capitalization)
3. The links will automatically work once the files are in place

## Current file paths expected:

- `/public/Immediate Pulmonary Fibrosis Prognosis Using Machine Learning Algorithms.pdf`
- `/public/Smart Solar Tracker.pdf`
- `/public/A Voice For The Voiceless.pdf`

The buttons in your portfolio will now link directly to these files and open them in new tabs.
